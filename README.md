# 2D Helmholtz PINN with SIREN

This repository contains a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) implementation to solve the 2D Helmholtz equation using a sinusoidal representation network (SIREN). The model is built and trained in **PyTorch**, and the notebook is designed to run in **Google Colab**.

## üìò Problem Overview

We solve the following PDE:
\[
-\nabla^2 u(x, y) - k_0^2 u(x, y) = f(x, y)
\]
- Complex-valued solution: \( u(x, y) = \text{Re}(u) + i \, \text{Im}(u) \)
- Point source \( f(x, y) = i \omega \delta(x - x_0, y - y_0) \)
- Open boundary conditions on all edges: \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + i k_0 u = 0\)

## üî¨ Features

- **SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Network)** for high-frequency solution modeling
- Point source at arbitrary location (default: \((-L/4, L/4)\))
- Circular inclusion with higher permittivity \( \varepsilon = 2 \) at the center
- Automatically handles spatially varying \( \varepsilon(x, y) \)
- Visualizations for:
  - Real part, Imaginary part, and Amplitude of predicted field
  - Comparison with analytical solution via Hankel function (Green's function)

## üß† Tech Stack

- Python + PyTorch
- Google Colab-compatible
- Visualization with Matplotlib
- Analytical solution from `scipy.special.hankel1`

## üìù Files

- `PINN_quick_test.ipynb` ‚Äî Main Colab notebook

## üß™ How to Use

1. Open `PINN_quick_test.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to train the PINN and visualize results.
3. Modify:
   - Point source location
   - Circle radius / permittivity
   - Network architecture

## üìå TODO

- [ ] Export trained model
- [ ] Allow arbitrary-shaped permittivity
- [ ] Add complex-field learning
